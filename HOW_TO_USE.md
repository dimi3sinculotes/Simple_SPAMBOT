# USAGE

## read README.md before this

I meant to make it the simpliest way posible, so the code is as readable as it can be, this way is great for someone who wants to do modifications over it, and for people who want to understand it, just make a new class or project, paste the code i've posted inside, and execute. 

During execution, all you need to do is to write your text, press enter and place your focus over the text area you want to spam.
