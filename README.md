# Simple_SPAMBOT
## Java simple SPAMBOT
   All it does, is read from standard.in (shell, cmd, netBeans execute window...) and for each character (use letters, comas and dots, any weird character besides that may make the program fail) write it and type enter, and for each space an underscore, so wherever you are you can annoy everyone with tons of notifications for one simple sentence
      
## Notice that:
  - The program will wait 3 seconds from where you press enter after typing your text and actuall spaming
  - Some platforms like for instants whatsApp web, have timers set, so your messeges will appear with the waiting icon and will be sent one each second more or less if there are to many.

## Quick example
### Input:
Stop ignoring me guys i need to know how many of you are coming right now

### Output: (again, the program does simulate pressing the actuall buttons, so it doesnt matter where you write it)
(ive pressed capslock before to give it even more emphasis)
